# ALX Listing App

This project is a web application that serves as a simplified Airbnb clone. The main goal is to create a dynamic and user-friendly listing page where users can browse, search for, and view details about various properties. The application focuses on core front-end functionalities like component-based UI development, state management, and API integration to fetch and display listing data.

### Project Structure

The project is organized to be modular and easy to navigate. Here is a brief overview of the key directories:

* `src/components/`: This directory contains all the reusable UI components of the application. Each component is self-contained and responsible for a specific part of the user interface (e.g., `ListingCard.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, `Searchbar.jsx`).
* `src/interfaces/`: This directory holds TypeScript interfaces and type definitions. It's used to enforce consistent data structures for objects like a `Listing` or a `User`, which helps prevent bugs and improves code clarity.
* `src/constants/`: This directory stores constant values used throughout the application, such as API endpoints, configuration settings, or fixed strings. Keeping them in one place makes the application easier to configure and maintain.
* `public/assets/`: This directory is for static assets that are served directly by the web server. It contains files like images, fonts, and other media that do not need to be processed by the build tool.
